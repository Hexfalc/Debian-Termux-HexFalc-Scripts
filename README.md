# HexFalc's Debian Termux Scripts
Just some shitty scripts I made for fast installing Debian using proot-distro

At the moment there is only one script and a tutorial to only install a GUI version of Debian.

I'm not good at this things so feel free to give suggestions and report issues and mistakes in the issue and pull request sections.

# Installation Istructions
You can find installation instructions here:
